# Node-snappy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kesla/node-snappy.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kesla/node-snappy)

## About

Node module/wrapper for Google's fast compressor/decompressor: <http://code.google.com/p/snappy/>

Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable and MapReduce to our internal RPC systems. (Snappy has previously been referred to as “Zippy” in some presentations and the likes.)

## Installation

```
  npm install snappy
```

## Examples
### String
```js
var snappy = require('snappy');
// Use synchronous version
var compressed = snappy.compressSync('string to compress');
var result = snappy.decompressSync(compressed, snappy.parsers.string);
// result will be string instead of Buffer
console.log(result);
```

### JSON
```js
var snappy = require('snappy');
// Snappy automatically convert json to a string
snappy.compress({"foo": "bar"}, function(err, compressed){
  snappy.decompress(compressed, snappy.parsers.json, function(err, result){
    // result will be json instead of Buffer
    console.log(result["foo"]);
  });
});
```

## API
### snappy.compress(input, cb)

Compress `input`, which can be a Buffer, String or arbitrary JavaScript object and call `cb` with `err` and `compressed`.

### snappy.compressSync(input)

Compress `input`, which can be a Buffer, String or arbitrary JavaScript object and return `compressed`. Throws if an error occurs.

### snappy.decompress(compressed, parse, cb)

Decompress `compressed` using `parse` as parser (defaults to `raw`) and call `cb` with `err` and `decompressed`.

### snappy.decompressSync(str, parse)

Decompress `compressed` using `parse` as parser (defaults to `raw`) and return `decompressed`. Throws if an error occurs.

## Parsers

* json
* string
* raw
